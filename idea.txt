2. **Login/Signup Page** (Optional for tracking across devices):
   - Simple login/sign-up with email or social media (Google, Facebook).

3. **Home Screen (Dashboard)**:
   - This is where the user will be greeted with a snapshot of their finances. It will show key metrics like:

     - Progress towards set budget goals (e.g., spending limits).
     - Quick access to log a new expense.
   
4. **Add Expense Page**:

     - Date selector (optional, defaults to today).
   
5. **Expense History Page**:

    - Graphs and charts to show spending trends over time (monthly trends, yearly trends, etc.).

    - Simple help section or about the app (developer contact, terms of service, etc.).

### **UI Layouts:**
Each page should be minimalistic and easy to use, with a focus on functionality and data visibility. You should stick to a few UI principles:
- **Consistency**: Keep fonts, buttons, and icons consistent across all pages.
- **Simplicity**: Each screen should be simple and easy to navigate.
- **Feedback**: Provide clear feedback (success, error, confirmation) when a user completes an action (e.g., logging an expense).

### **Color Scheme Using the 60-30-10 Rule:**

The 60-30-10 rule is a design principle for balancing colors. It divides the color scheme into three components:
- **60%** of your design should be the dominant color (background, large sections, etc.).
- **30%** should be the secondary color (menus, buttons, subheadings).
- **10%** should be the accent color (for highlights, icons, notifications, or calls-to-action).

**For a professional and modern finance app, here’s an example color scheme:**

#### **1. Dominant Color (60%)**:  
- **Dark Blue** (#1A2A6C) – This provides a professional, reliable feel. It’s a calming and trustworthy color suitable for a finance app.

#### **2. Secondary Color (30%)**:
- **Light Grey** (#F1F1F1) – A neutral color that complements dark blue, creating a clean and modern look.
- **Light Blue** (#00B0FF) – A bright, energetic contrast that adds vibrancy to your design without being overwhelming.

#### **3. Accent Color (10%)**:
- **Golden Yellow** (#FFD700) – A bright and energetic color that will highlight important buttons (like ‘Add Expense’, ‘Set Budget’) and notifications. This color invokes positivity and urgency, perfect for financial apps.

### **Visual Design & UI Style:**
- **Typography**: Use modern sans-serif fonts like **Roboto** or **Open Sans** for readability. The font weight and size can vary, but keep headings bold and body text regular.
  
- **Icons**: Use simple, intuitive icons. Material Design icons are great for mobile apps and integrate well with Android Studio. 
  - For example, use icons like a "wallet" for expenses, a "chart" for analytics, and a "bell" for notifications.

- **Buttons & Interactions**:
  - Use **rounded buttons** with a slight shadow to create depth.
  - For the ‘Add Expense’ button, use the **golden yellow accent color** to make it pop.
  - Use **subtle animations** for transitions between pages (e.g., when opening the "Add Expense" page).

- **Graphs & Data Visualization**:
  - Use pie charts, bar graphs, and line charts to visualize spending and progress.
  - Keep the graphs simple with clear labels and avoid too much clutter.
